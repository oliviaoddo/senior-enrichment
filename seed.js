// Re render after campus is deleted
// how do states work when splitting the store up into different files
// should forms have local state
// ternary with get all campuses and students
// dispatch get all in main component and dispatching again after delete
// prefilling in text input with state mapped to props
// file input
// switched to BrowserRouter and photos broke

//Things to do:
// on submit clear the local state, maybe move the submit function outside of the map to props
// when all students have null campuses the app breaks
//change to browser router
// handle validation error when editing a student, giving an existing email fails silently
// change editing placeholders to values because they might not want to edit all fields
//refactor models, using include etc.
// possibly make the forms their own components
// updating the campus and going back to the all students view...they have the old campus name
// try adding a search on the students and campuses that filters them as the user types (all campus/student) view and the campus view search through those students
// for adding a new student use find or create by email
